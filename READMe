# Data Agent

## Project Overview

This repository contains a data agent project, designed for processing and analyzing data, potentially related to energy consumption. While a detailed description was not provided, the structure and files suggest capabilities for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Data Processing:** Handles binary data files (e.g., `data_level0.bin`, `header.bin`, `length.bin`, `link_lists.bin`).
*   **Data Storage:** Utilizes `chroma.sqlite3` for persistent data storage, likely leveraging a vector database.
*   **Data Analysis:** Implements data analysis functionalities using Python.
*   **Data Visualization:** Generates HTML-based charts for visualizing data insights (see `local_charts/`).

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher.
*   **pip:** Python package installer.

The project likely depends on several Python libraries, which can be installed after cloning the repository. A `pyproject.toml` file is provided, which often implies the use of `poetry` or a similar dependency management tool. Key dependencies may include (but are not limited to):

*   `chromadb`
*   `pandas`
*   `matplotlib` or `plotly`
*   `vanna`
*   Other libraries used for data processing, numerical computation, and visualization.

* **env** To be created inside src/core 
 
## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/limwei97/data_agent.git
    cd data_agent
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    If a `requirements.txt` file is present, use:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If using `poetry` (check `pyproject.toml` for `poetry` configuration):

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    If using `uv`:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    If not using a dependency manager and no `requirements.txt` is provided, install libraries manually as you encounter `ImportError`s during runtime, referring to the import statements in the Python files to identify which libraries are needed.

3.  **Environment Setup (if applicable):**

    *   If the project relies on any environment variables, set them accordingly (refer to any documentation or configuration files) as per .env.development

4. **Run the Data Agent**:

   Run adk web
   Instructions will depend on the specific application that uses the data agent. Inspect the source code within the `src/` directory to understand how to execute the main application.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

To view the generated charts, simply open the HTML files in a web browser (e.g., `local_charts/average_energy_consumption_comparison.html`).

## Configuration Options

Configuration options depend on the specific functionalities implemented within the source code. Examine the Python scripts (`src/`) for any configurable parameters or settings.
The `app.log` file suggests the use of logging; configuration for logging may be available.
